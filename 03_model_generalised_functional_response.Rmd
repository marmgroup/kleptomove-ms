# Ecology: Intake in relation to individuals and items

We fit a GLM with per-capita intake rate as the response, and items and individuals as the predictors, and extract the coefficients (and p-values) of each for every regrowth rate and simulation type.

## Get libraries

```{r}
# load libs
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(colorspace)
library(patchwork)
```

## Load data and split

```{r}
# read in data
data = fread("data/results/data_funresp_general.csv")
head(data)
```

```{r}
# split the data
data_model <- split(data, by = c("sim_type", "replicate", "regrowth", "gen", 
                                 "variable"))
```
